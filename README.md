# BasicDiscordBot

## A first attempt at using the Discord API, simple call and response functionality only

### I intend to continue developing this incrementally, as a means of experimentation.

At present the bot listens for phrases commonly referenced in relation to CR7, and responds with a hard-coded response. 

## Future improvements:
 - [] Add slash command functionality to add additional phrases for response, or to change the response it has
 - [] Add a temporary ban feature for individuals overusing the meme
 - [] Add autoplaying video with a 1 phrase listener
